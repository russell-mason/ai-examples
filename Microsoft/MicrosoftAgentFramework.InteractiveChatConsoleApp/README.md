# Getting Started

The following assumes you're using Visual Studio, so adjust accordingly for other IDEs.

### This is the entry point for a simple Microsoft Agent Framework interactive chat client

**N.B.** Ensure you set **MicrosoftAgentFramework.InteractiveChatConsoleApp** as the startup project.

-   This is for experimental purposes only, and not intended to be a serious application
-   It only uses default features, and does't use any additional tools

### Configuration

Configuration for this is located in the **AIExamples.Shared** project, in the **appsettings.json** file.

See the [README](../AIExamples.Shared/README.md) file in **AIExamples.Shared** for more details.
